# The Invisible Wire

## Concept

A wireless channel is an invisible wire that is generally defined by two things: a frequency and a bandwidth.  Rather than focus too much on the physics of frequency, let's use music to describe how communications work in the abstract.  

In order to transmit information, radios sing.  In general, "frequency" is "pitch": it describes how low or how high a note is when the radio sings it.  Bandwidth describes all of the different pitches that the radio will use when singing a particular song.  The volume of the song is called "power".  A radio's hearing acuity is measured by its "sensitivity".  The language of the song is its "modulation", and the number of times each word in the song is repeated is the "coding".

When radios are far away from one another, they may wish to use a megaphone \("antenna"\).  The megaphone amplifies and directs a radio's voice in a way that depends largely on the construction of the megaphone.  The specific amplification of the voice is described as "gain", and the way the megaphone directs the radio's voice is described by a "pattern".  

As in real life: if one radio sings too loudly next to another, the listening radio can be hurt.  Over time, this may lead to hearing loss \(or, in extreme cases, deafness\).

So what happens if a radio sings in a range that another radio can't actually hear?  Well, for an example of this, let's consider the dog whistle.

In the olden days, people found themselves with a problem: they had a dog, but didn't want to scream at the top of their lungs to summon the creature.  When someone screams like that, the volume required could have a tendency to bother both the person doing the screaming and the neighbors who might have to suffer through it.  For many years, though, yelling was about as good as it got.

At some point, some clever soul discovered that dogs can hear certain things that humans can't.   This led to the creation of a little tool called the dog whistle.  A dog whistle generates a loud noise in a range that most humans can't hear, which allows one to successfully irritate their dog without giving themselves a headache and / or waking up the neighbors.
