# Module Overview

This module covers the basics of how one can remove wires from a project.  Note that only the very basics of wireless transmission are covered here.  The goal is to offer enough information that one might be able to interpret basic specifications for a radio.  From there, the document offers an introduction to Bluetooth, and explains how one can use Bluetooth to facilitate communication between remote devices.

Before operating any radio device, please be sure to research \(and abide by\) relevant guidelines and / or regulations which may apply.  

Further, note that the radio identified in this module is intended for use only within the US \(e.g. it falls within the 902 - 928 MHz ISM band\).  If following this guide in a different country, it may be necessary to use a different radio.
