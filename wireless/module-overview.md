# Module Overview

This module covers the basics of how one can remove wires from a project.  Note that only the very basics of wireless transmission are covered here.  The goal is to offer enough information that one might be able to interpret basic specifications for a radio.  From there, the document offers an introduction to Bluetooth, and explains how one can use Bluetooth to facilitate communication between remote devices.
