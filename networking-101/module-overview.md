# Module Overview

### Overview

Just about every Arduino tutorial on the planet starts with "blink" - someone takes an LED, writes a little code, and watches a little light turn off ... then on ... then off ... then on.  While fulfilling \(and often entertaining for far longer than it should be\), there comes a point where one needs to move on ...

... or does there?  This module takes a basic blink demonstration and tries to spice it up a little bit: instead of one device instructs another device to turn its LED off ... then on ... then off ... then on.  In this process, one begins to learn networking fundamentals.

Once this works for two TeensyLC devices, a third device is added to the mix.  In order to talk to the third TeensyLC, it becomes necessary to address a few things, including a shared medium and the necessity to address individual messages to a destination.

At the end of this module, the student will have built a functional, extendable network \(on top of GPIO\) that is capable of driving a LED on one \(or more\) connected devices.

### Materials

* 3x TeensyLC devices
  * These devices can be purchased with headers pre-soldered
* Wire
