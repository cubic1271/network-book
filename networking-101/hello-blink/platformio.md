# PlatformIO

PlatformIO is an Integrated Development Environment \(IDE\).  It offers support for a number of different common development boards.  Critically, this IDE offers straightforward support for Arduino-based projects that span multiple files.  When working with more powerful microcontrollers and developing reusable code, support for this kind of improved organization is useful.

As such, PlatformIO is the default IDE adopted for in this guide.
