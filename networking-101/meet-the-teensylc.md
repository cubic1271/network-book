# Meet the TeensyLC

{% hint style="info" %}
Any platform with a functional set of$$I^2C$$pins and around 48KB of SRAM should suffice for this: SRAM limitations on the traditional Arduino platform make it difficult to use for later chapters.  Also, note that different systems may require some additional effort to configure $$I^2C$$pins as needed by this tutorial.
{% endhint %}

LC =&gt; Low Cost.  Cortex M0, still substantially more horsepower than an Arduino Uno.
